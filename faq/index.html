                <h2>What is btcpos.cash ?</h2>
                <p>btcpos.cash is a point-of-sale system that allows merchants to easily accept Bitcoin lightning
                    payments
                    without running a node. This is possible by leveraging the Liquid network and the Boltz exchange.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>Bitcoin POS is configured with your Liquid wallet's confidential descriptor (<a
                        href="">ELIP-151</a>),
                    See our <a href="../docs/">CT Descriptor Tutorials</a> for supported wallet.
                    The CT descriptor allows to generate wallet addresses but not sign transactions and spend funds.
                    It is what is called a watch-only wallet.
                    With the wallet address an invoice is createad using <a href="https://boltz.exchange/">Boltz</a>
                    exchange,
                    this is the step that requires the payment of the fees.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item" id="fees">
                <h2>Why are there fees?</h2>
                <p>The fee of 0.25% + 50 sats per invoice is charged entirely by the
                    <a href="https://boltz.exchange/">Boltz exchange</a> service to perform the Lightning-to-Liquid
                    swap.
                    <strong>btcpos.cash does not add any markup</strong> on top of this.
                </p>
                <p>In exchange for this small fee, you get significant advantages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No node required</strong> — You don't need to run or maintain a Lightning node,
                        which typically requires technical expertise, 24/7 uptime, and channel management.</li>
                    <li><strong>No registration</strong> — There's no sign-up process, no accounts to create,
                        and no KYC. Just configure your wallet descriptor and start accepting payments immediately.</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-custody</strong> — Funds go directly to your Liquid wallet.
                        You maintain full control of your money at all times.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item" id="recovery">
                <h2>Rescue file</h2>
                <p>A reverse submarine swap, also known as a Lightning-to-Liquid swap, never
                    trap user funds, meaning that if the merchant wallet is not claiming funds,
                    the lightning payment don't get through. In other words, there is never a situation
                    where the payer wallet show a payment get through and the merchant wallet don't receive it.<br>

                    However, the POS is generating a mnemonic to spend the claim script and claim the funds.
                    This mnemonic is generated randomly and stored locally in your browser.<br>

                    It is available for download by triple-clicking on the wallet ID at the bottom of the page.
                    The format is compatible with the <a href="https://boltz.exchange/">Boltz exchange</a> recovery
                    tool.

            <div class="faq-item" id="supply-chain">
                <h2>Mitigating supply chain attacks</h2>
                <p>Since btcpos.cash runs entirely in your browser, you're trusting the server to deliver
                    unmodified code each time you load the page. A compromised server could theoretically
                    serve malicious code that leaks your descriptor or misdirects payments.</p>

                <p>To mitigate this risk, you can <strong>install the app locally</strong> using your browser's
                    "Install as app" feature. Once installed, the app runs from your device's cache and no longer
                    fetches code from the server on each use.</p>

                <br>
                <p><strong>How to install:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Configure your POS and generate the link (e.g., <code>https://btcpos.cash/#eyJ...</code>)</li>
                    <li>In the URL bar, <strong>replace <code>#</code> with <code>?</code></strong>
                        (e.g., <code>https://btcpos.cash/?eyJ...</code>)</li>
                    <li>Navigate to the modified URL</li>
                    <li>In Chrome: click the install icon in the address bar, or use Menu → "Install Bitcoin POS"</li>
                    <li>The app is now installed with your configuration baked in</li>
                </ol>

                <br>
                <p><strong>Why replace # with ?</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The <code>#</code> fragment is normally used because it's never sent to the server, protecting
                    your descriptor privacy. However, browsers strip the <code>#</code> fragment when installing
                    as an app. Using <code>?</code> preserves the configuration in the installed app's start URL.
                    The privacy trade-off is minimal since you're already trusting the server at install time.
                    After installation, the app works offline and your configuration
                    remains private — it's only stored locally on your device.
